## My process

I tried using the BEM CSS methodology in this project to make it easy for others to understand the code, however, I did not follow this methodology strictly. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
It is best practice to set your base font-size to 100%, and use relative units like "rem/em" for other font-sizes for accessibility purposes. Using an absolute unit as the base font-size will make it imposible for the user to configure the font-size in the browser settings. A font-size of 100% is equal to 16px font-size in most browsers.

```css
html {
  font-size: 100%;
}
```
### Continued development

Making the project responsive was a bit of a challenge to me. I'll like to focus more on learning how to make
responsive websites.
